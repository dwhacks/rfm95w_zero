rfm95w_zero is a Meshtastic project to use some hardware I had laying around.

CURRENTLY UNTESTED
*but boards are on order*

To Build firmware, have your Meshtastic build enviroment in VS code as per the instructions at: https://meshtastic.org/docs/development/firmware/build/

Copy the rfm95w_zero folder from "Variants" in this repo into variants/rp2040/ in the Meshtastic folder you pulled from github.

Good luck, I will update when I get the boards in!
